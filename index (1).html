        <h1>Welcome to George Mason University</h1>
        <h3>SWE 645: Component-based Software Development</h3>
        <p><b>Objective:</b><br/>This class will be a detailed study of the concepts and engineering principles of software component and component-based software systems. 
            After the course, students should be prepared to create large-scale component-based containerized Web applications on AWS platform. 
            The course is designed to provide a hands-on experience in DevOps engineering and core AWS services.</p>
        <p><b>Content:</b><br/>SWE 645 covers some of the topics related to the software development models
            that are used to support component-based software systems. We will be
            studying the software design and development side of component-based
            software that includes design principles to architect resilient, highly available,
            and scalable microservices-based applications in AWS cloud. The course
            content will largely focus on server-side software design and development. We
            will learn technologies such as <b>Microservices, Docker Containers, Container
                management platform - Kubernetes, DevOps principles with CI/CD
                pipeline, Infrastructure as Code â€“ Terraform, Configuration Management
                Using Ansible, GitOps, Resilient Architectures in AWS cloud, as well as
                core AWS services, such as compute, networking, storage, and database.</b>
            Students will have options to do homework assignments/project on Amazon
            Web Services (AWS) and/or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
            Though SWE 619 is the only required prerequisite, other topics such as web
            based Java programming (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SpringBoot) and database
            as a background knowledge will be helpful. SWE 642, though not a required
            prerequisite, is a great background course for these topics. The class will be
            very practical (how to build things) and require extensive programming
            assignments.
